## Task 5

> Objective: To calculate complex expressions using standard C mathematical functions.
> Option: 4.

### Command performed

```bash
git checkout -b lab_05
mkdir lab_05
cd lab_05
nvim main.cpp
...
g++ -g main.cpp -o main
./main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: lab_05"
git push lab_05
```

### Algorithm
